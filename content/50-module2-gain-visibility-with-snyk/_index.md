# Introduction

At this point, we've created an environment with a live repository and a working CI/CD pipeline that pushes a container image to Amazon ECR.  This represents a steady-state mode of operation that should be familiar to most teams that build and deploy their software. In this Module, we'll guide you through executing Snyk's tests in ways that reflect a typical Snyk adoption journey. 

For many teams, the initial intent is to Gain Visibility into their application security without interfering with Developer Workflows. To accomplish this, we'll use Snyk's integrations into Bitbucket and ECR. 

We'll also demonstrate how Snyk can be integrated into CI/CD Pipelines, which in many cases requires Developer involvement.
