# Overview
We'll start by reviewing the Open Source vulnerabilities in the Goof application. Now that you've connected your Bitbucket Repo and ECR into Snyk, you can review the findings directly within the Snyk UI.

### Step 1 - Review Snyk Open Source results
Let's start by reviewing the vulnerabilities introduced into the Container from the Open Source Libraries used by the Goof application. Click into the package.json under either the Bitbucket Import or ECR Import.

The default Issues view shows an Issue Card for each Vulnerability. In the Snyk UI, issues are organized by Snyk's Priority Score, which considers factors such as availability of a fix, exploitability, and others to help you focus on the most important issues. Hover over each Issue's Priority Score to show what factors influenced the score for that issue.

### Step 2 - Filter Snyk Open Source results
From this view, the filters on the left help to narrow down the most urgent issues to fix. Apply the filters for "Critical", "Exploitable", and "Fix Available" to focus your attention on Exploitable, Fixable, Critical Severity Issues to start.

These capabilities are intended to help teams reduce the issue backlog to the most Critical Issues that are actionable. They can help teams focus initial remediation efforts and build momentum around fixing.
