# Introduction
In this module, we'll set up your environment on the Atlassian stack with a sample repository. We'll walk through the process of forking the public repository, configuring repository variables, cloning the repo to the Cloud9 IDE, and running a CI/CD pipeline using [Bitbucket Pipelines](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/get-started-with-bitbucket-pipelines/).

## Time
Module 1 should take about 20 minutes to configure and setup.
